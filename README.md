# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Machine-Learning
Classifying Cancer cells into Benign and Malignant using <b>Support Vector Machine classification</b> algorithm.

Breast Cancer, the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25% of all cancer cases affected more than 2.5 million people in 2018. Early diagnosis increase the chances of survival significantly. 

A key challenge in cancer is how to classify cancel cells into Malignant and Benign. Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79% accuracy while 91% correct diagnosis is achieved using Machine Learning Techniques.

In this case study our task is to classify Tumour cells into Malignant and Benign using features obtained from several cells images. I have classified the cells using Support Vector Machine Classifier. Found the best parameters using GridSearch to improve the model  achieving an accuracy of 96%.
